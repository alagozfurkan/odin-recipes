    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Contrary to belief, the national dish of Turkey is not Kebab, Lahmacun or Menemen. Instead, many locals will name Kuru Fasulye, a fiery stew of white beans that have been slow-cooked in a rich tomato, pepper and chilli broth.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>320 g dried white beans (haricot)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tbsp salt (24g)</li>
        <li>00 ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp Biber şalçası</li>
        <li>Freshly steamed rice & Turkish pickles to serve</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beans and 1 tbsp (14g) of the salt to a mixing bowl, cover them generously with water and soak overnight.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste, pepper paste and black pepper and continue frying until the pastes have dissolved into the oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour in the water to stop the frying, then drain the beans, rinse them and add to the casserole as well.</li>
        <li>Trim the chillis and green pepper, cut the green pepper into chunks and add both to the casserole. </li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil, then cover it with a lid and simmer for 75 minutes, stirring every now and then, until the beans are tender.</li>
        <li>Once tender, season them with the remaining ¾ tbsp (10g) of salt and continue cooking for another 10 minutes to let the beans absorb the salt.</li>
        <li>Divide over plates and serve alongside freshly steamed rice and Turkish pickles.</li>
    </ol>
